# 🌿 Plant Species Classification

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch, along with OpenCV and Pillow (PIL) for image preprocessing, to classify plant species based on leaf images. It leverages computer vision techniques to extract texture, shape, and color features to accurately identify plant types.
